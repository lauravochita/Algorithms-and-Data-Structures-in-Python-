    "# Algorithms and Data Structures in Python â€” Assignment IV\n",
    "\n",
    "The following assignment will test your understanding of topics covered in the six weeks of the course. This assignment will count towards your grade and should be submitted through Canvas by 12.10.2023 at 08:59 (CEST). You are required to work and prepare your submissions in groups with 3 students per group. You can get at most **10 points for Assignment IV**, which is 10\\% of your final grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For submission, please rename your notebook as ```{first_student_id}_{second_student_id}_{third_student_id}_iiib.ipynb```. For example, submission by students with student ID numbers *11760001*, *11760002* and *11760003* should have the filename ```11760001_11760002_11760003_iiib.ipynb```.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Please follow the function prototype specified in the question for writing your code. The usage of additional functions is acceptable unless the problem expressly prohibits it. If this structure is modified, it will fail automated testing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. All submissions will be checked for code similarity. Submissions with high similarity will be summarily rejected and no points will be awarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Please do NOT use the ```input()``` function in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. For each exercise the correct solution counts for the 80% of the exercise's points, while code style counts for the remaining 20%. Please, make sure that you explain what your implementation does using comments."

    "## Working with Classes ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Social networks are essentially massive graphs that connect people to other people. Classes are a powerful tool for building and representing such complex networks. In this assignment, you will build a (simplified) backbone for a social media network. This network allows users to add other users as friends, follow them and send them messages. You will build this using a graph. A graph is composed\n",
    "of nodes (vertices) connected with edges. The nodes in this task are users whereas the edges are\n",
    "friendship/followership links between them. For this exercise, you will write three classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A ```User``` class that manages user-level attributes (friends, followers, messages) in a single compact data unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A ```SocialNetwork``` class that manages the creation, deletion and storage of ```users```. It also manages the creation and deletion of friendship/followership relations between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An ```App``` class that allows a single user to login and view messages from friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at these classes separately."

    "1. ```real_name``` should accept the user's real-world name and save it within an instance variable.\n",
    "2. ```user_name``` should accept the user's service-specific username (similar to Twitter's handle) and save it within an instance variable. Two distinct users cannot have the same user_name.\n",

A friendship is a mutual bidirectional relationship where both parties share information. For this homework, remember just this: Followers are one-sided while friendships are mutual. Followers need to be removed only from the record of the ```User``` they're following whereas friendships need to be managed on both ends.\n",
